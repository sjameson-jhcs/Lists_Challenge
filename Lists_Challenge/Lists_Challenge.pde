// 1. Create an array called "my_favorite_foods" that has room for 5 words
// 2. Populate "my_favorite_foods" array with your favorite foods
// 3. Loop through the array and to print a complete sentence that lists your favorite foods on a single line.
// 4. After your code prints the sentence from task 3, change the last item in your list to "Broccoli"
// 5. Print your list a second time with the new broccoli entry. Again, keep it to a single line.
// 6. Create a map of your current "my_class_sechedule". The key will be a number 1 to 7 and the value will be the name of the class you are taking.
// 7. Use your map to print the following "On Tuesday mornings I have [your period 3] followed by [your period 1]".
// 8. Create a two dimensional array of letters representing the pieces on a chess board using the following letters:
//    P = Pawn, R = Rook, B = Bishop, K = Knight, Q = Queen, K = King, E = empty spots at the start of game
// 9. Print your array of chess board letters in a box just as they would appear on the board. Each row
